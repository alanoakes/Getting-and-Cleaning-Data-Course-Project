# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The outline of the R script accomplishes the following tasks:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. This includes the "Subjects" and "Labels".
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement using grep function.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set by the factors function.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names by the gsub function.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
